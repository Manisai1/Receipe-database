# Receipe-database
Design and implement a database system for a Recipe Manager Application that allows users to store, organize, and share recipes efficiently. The system replaces traditional handwritten recipe books and scattered digital notes, ensuring easy search, ingredient tracking, meal planning, and personalized recipe recommendations.

Description
A recipe management system is essential for home cooks, chefs, and food enthusiasts who want to store, categorize, and share their recipes. Users face challenges such as managing ingredient lists, tracking nutritional values, avoiding duplicate recipes, and planning meals effectively.

The new database system will allow:

Users to register and create personal recipe collections.

Recipes to be categorized based on cuisine type, difficulty level, preparation time, and diet preferences.

Ingredient tracking to monitor availability and suggest grocery lists.

Meal planning to schedule recipes for upcoming days/weeks.

Nutritional analysis to display calorie counts, protein, fats, and carbs.

User ratings and reviews to provide feedback on recipes.

Recipe sharing so users can publish and explore community recipes.

Automated recommendations based on user preferences and past selections.

Search functionality based on ingredients, keywords, or cooking methods.

Cooking history tracking to help users revisit their most frequently made recipes.

The system must handle large recipe databases, multi-user interactions, and high-frequency searches, ensuring quick access, accurate ingredient management, and secure user data.
